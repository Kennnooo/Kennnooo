<h3 align="center">Hi There! ðŸ‘‹</h3>

###

I'm Aarav, a Software Engineer who started out specializing in Frontend Development.
I loved building clean, responsive websites and exploring the latest in web tech.

Now, Iâ€™m fully diving into AI and Generative AI, refining my skills and shifting my focus toward the future of technology. I like to think of myself as an ex-Frontend developer turned AI learner â€” because I believe great design starts with great code, and now, great intelligence.

Except for programming, I enjoy watching anime, playing games, and touching grass.
